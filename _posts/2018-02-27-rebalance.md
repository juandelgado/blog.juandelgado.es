Almost exactly a year ago I [twitted](https://twitter.com/wadus/status/829807244015464448):

I was still living in London, barely a month before [moving back to Spain](http://blog.juandelgado.es/2017/01/10/stepping-down/). When I did early March I knew I had a window of opportunity until girlfriend and kids would relocate too. 

My window of opportunity lasted until late July and it was just about enough time to write down the basics of the "book". I have barely touched it since then and I doubt I'm going to have the chance to do so in the near future. 

But as you know full well, unreleased products provide zero value to anybody, and I like to think that even this super early, nowhere near finished version has _some_ value. If released. And I'm willing to be ashamed of the first version of my product. So here it is: 

[Re/Balance](https://leanpub.com/rebalance)

This is the main premise:

**Client / agency relationships are unbalanced**. Clients take most of the risks, but also most of the rewards (if things go well). Agencies barely take any risks, their income almost guaranteed regardless of actual product performance. I believe this is the source of many of the behaviours we see in the industry.

And I also believe that at least some teams, some clients, some products can be done differently. But **we need a new kind of relationship based on collaboration, empathy and humility**.

Now, I haven't had time to get anywhere a finished version of what you would call a book, and in a way it's the hardest part that is missing. But I still think those 70 pages have some value.

If you work in the digital industry you have probably experienced some of the pains described in the book. Re/Balance will probably resonate and hopefully be worth the (voluntary) $2.99 and the time spent reading it.

$$$ is always appreciated, but probably more so at this stage is feedback:

 * Does it resonate?
 * Do you also see the issues it outlines?
 * Do you agree with that potential solution would be fantastic but incredibly hard to pull off?
 * Have you seen fundamentally different client / agency relationships?

I would love to hear from you! Please swing by [Re/Balance home page on my site](http://juandelgado.es/rebalance/) or through [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/rebalance).

However far it goes, I'll be FOREVER GRATEFUL to the early feedback team, particularly [Isa](https://twitter.com/ludita), [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamtaylo), [Gianpi](https://twitter.com/_gianpi_) and [Narges](https://twitter.com/nargesjalali).
