So, back in business. Where was I? [Here](http://blog.zarate.tv/2011/11/19/write-once-compile-everywhere/), almost 2 years ago, talking about upcoming alternatives to Flash. The blog got hacked and because I just couldn't bare the pain of maintaining another Wordpress blog I simply stopped blogging. Almost.

Google+ was oh, so convinient, that I took it [there](https://plus.google.com/u/0/116335321298644733410/posts) for a while. That was until I realised a very tiny detail, which is that G+ does not offer an RSS feed of your posts. That's. Not. Cool. Add to it the killing of Google Reader and I had basically enough. I think it's important that we keep an open web. 

But yeah, whatever. Loads of things have happened. Youview launched and with it [over 2 years of work with Channel 4](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/08/ustwo/) (probably [ustwo](http://ustwo.com)'s last Flash project ever), I spent over 1 year as a free spirit in the studio (gave me the opportunity to play with the [real](http://www.ustwo.co.uk/blog/midi-controller-to-philips-hue/) [world](http://ustwo.com/blog/digitally-engaged/)), but most significantly I got heavily involved in testing automation. Yep yep.

I gave a talk at last year's Digital Shoreditch ([BDD, TDD and all that bollocks](http://lanyrd.com/2013/digital-shoreditch-festival/scdwxp/)), landed [a few commits into Calabash Android](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-android/commits?author=juandelgado) and I've now spent the last 3 months as a full time tester! But don't worry, I'm not planning to fully switch. It's a bit of an odd situation, so I took one for the team. In all fairness, I'm quite happy things have played out the way they have, the role of a tester definitely gives a developer a different point of view.

So that's it for now, as you can see there's a lot to do around here, although I might just leave the default [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) template, is not that bad is it? Best of all is that this is plain HTML [hosted on Github](https://github.com/juandelgado/blog.juandelgado.es), go hack that!

Anyway, see you soon : )
